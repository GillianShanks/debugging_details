# Debugging Tools In IntelliJ

After watching this video: [Intro to Debugging video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErVZrVWZrko&feature=youtu.be)

Answer the following questions:

* What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

   This is where the debugging tool pauses in the code to show the state of the data at that point.
 
* Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
   
   No the line of code is not run.
   
* How do we debug the next line of code?
   
   By clicking the "step over (F8)" button it runs the line of code you are on and takes you on to the start of the next line of code.
   
* What does the step into command do?
   
   The "step into" button will take you into the start of the function being run on that line of code.
   
* What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
   
   "Evaluate expression" allows you to run one line of code using the current state of the programme (no use of `;`). "Evaluate code fragment" allows several lines of code to be run as normal Java, and you can create new temporary variables.
